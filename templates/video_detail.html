                I'm a Pre & Postnatal Fitness Instructor/Yoga & Pilates Teacher, Certified Pregnancy and Postpartum Core Exercise Specialist, and Registered Dietitian.<br><br>
                It's my passion to share pregnancy/postpartum workouts and natural birth education to help you prepare for your positive birth and faster recovery.
                I healed my 4-finger diastasis recti gap and a large focus of the channel is to help mothers heal their core and/or diastasis recti gap after pregnancy.

                When building your core after pregnancy, you should eat a well-balanced diet that includes nutrient-rich foods to support healing and provide energy. Here are some foods to focus on:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lean proteins:</strong> Fish, chicken, nuts, and beans can help you feel full and support recovery after exercise.</li>
                <li><strong>Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables:</strong> These foods are high in fiber, which can help with constipation, and provide quick-burning energy. Fruits and vegetables also contain vitamins and minerals that support recovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Foods with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants:</strong> These foods promote muscle recovery.</li>
            </ul>
